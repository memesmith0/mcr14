mcr14 - tiny posix macros - we implement syntax so you don't have to

mcr14 is a prototype for an advanced macro system where the macros have macros.

1. I can attach mcr14 to most languages
2. I can begin writing in that language as I normally do
3. If I find that I want to change the way that language is written, I can write a macro in the middle of my code. even if my code is compiled or if it is interpreted.
4. If I find that I want to change the way that my macros are written, the macros have macros. so in the middle of my code I can modify the macro langauge.
5. if I find I want to create my own macro system instead, mcr14 supports this
